In this project, we will provide a travel guide for the California visitors.
First, we will show them the best landmarks, restaurants and hotels in CA using different graphs. Second, we will ask them for a city input. Third, we will display a basic overview of the city with a paragraph and dataframe. Lastly, we will use natural language processing to analyze the reviews for different businesses in California.
