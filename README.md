Introduction: 
The project on this page provides an overview of the final project we did for our class. This project is done by a group of 3 students: Stephanie (Hiu Man) Lam, Chloe (Jieyi) Chen, and Janet Loyola 
We divided our project into 4 parts, including data wrangling, anaylsis and vistualization, review analysis, and interactive user input. At the end of this page, we will provides links to direct to the 4 parts of our project html where the codes could be seen.

With our passion of traveling, we are interested in helping the others to discover the most outstanding places in California focusing on only 3 categories: 
- hotels, restaurants, and landmarks. 

Our goal of the project is to provide a travel guide for California visitors by showing them the best hotels, restaurants, and landmarks with the applications of web data processing, interactive data vistualization, natural language processing, and interactive user input using Python.

Data Description:
I. Extracted and collected data from the Yelp Search API and performed a web scraping from Wikipedia page, we created a dataframe with business and California cities information.

Data Analysis:
II. Since we want our users to be able to track the different categories for their own personal needs, we used interactive plots to give the user a richer information experience.

-Restaurant
-Hotels
-Landmarks

III. By using natural language processing, we analyzed the reviews from the Yelp API and find the common words that are used in the review by analyzing the best rated nearby restaurants, hotels, landmarks for all the cities in California.

IV. With the application of interactive user input functions, we will try to provide a basic info of the city and best recommendations of restaurants, hotels and landmarks to the user by extracting informations from the Wikipedia. 

Conclusion & Next step:
Our next step of our travel guide would be creating a server-side framework like flask to create a website that could actually get the user inputs and display corresponding outputs and plots relative to whatever the users need.
