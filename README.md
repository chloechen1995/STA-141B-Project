Introduction

This webpage provides an overview of the final project that we did for the STA 141B class. The contributors of this projects are: Stephanie (Hiu Man) Lam, Chloe (Jieyi) Chen, and Janet Loyola 
We divided our project into 4 parts, which include data wrangling and anaylsis, vistualization, review analysis, and interactive user input. At the end of this page, we will provide links to the Jupyter Notebooks where the codes locate.

With our passion of traveling, we are interested in helping visitors to create an ideal travel plan in California. Specifically, we will be focusing on only 3 categories: 
- hotels, restaurants, and landmarks. 

The Techniques that we use are web data processing, interactive data vistualization, natural language processing, and interactive user input using Python.

Data Description:
- Extracted and collected data from the Yelp Search API and performed a web scraping from Wikipedia page, we created a dataframe with business and California cities information. Dataframe will contains information including Categories, City, Phone number, Id, Claimed, Closed, Mobile URL, Name, Rating, Review Count, Snippet Text, URL, Population, Latitude, and Longitude.

Analysis and Vistualization:

- Since we want our users to be able to keep track of the different categories that they might be interested in, we used interactive plots to provide a better user experience.

Review Analysis
- We used natural language processing to analyze the reviews from the Yelp API and find the common words that are used in the review by analyzing the best rated nearby restaurants, hotels and landmarks for all the cities in California. 

Interactive User Input
- With the application of interactive user input functions, we want to provide a basic info of the city and the best recommendations of restaurants, hotels and landmarks to the users based on their preferences.

Conclusion & Next Step

This travel guide has provided a comprehensive analysis for most restaurants, hotels and landmarks in California and make recommendations based on the users' preferences. Our next step will be creating a website that gets the user inputs displays the recommendations and plots. We will need to find a larger database that will contain more information and a web server that allows dynamic content. Furthermore, we will use this project as a template to create travel guides for other states as well.
