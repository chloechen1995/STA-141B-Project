## Welcome to our STA 141B Project GitHub Page

Title: California Travel Guide

Members: Janet Loyola, Hiu Man (Stephanie) Lam, Jieyi (Chloe) Chen

Introduction:

This webpage provides an overview of the final project that we did for the STA 141B class.
We divided our project into 4 parts, which include data wrangling and anaylsis, vistualization, review analysis, and interactive user input. 

With our passion of traveling, we are interested in helping visitors to create an ideal travel plan in California. Specifically, we will be focusing on the following 3 categories: 
- restaurants, hotels and landmarks. 

The Techniques that we use are web data processing, interactive data vistualization, natural language processing, and interactive user input using Python.

Data Wrangling: (Please check out: Part_I_Data Wrangling.ipynb)
- Extracted and collected data from the Yelp API Search and performed a web scraping from Wikipedia page. We have created a dataframe with the business and California cities' information. The dataframe contains the following: Categories, City, Phone number, Id, Claimed, Closed, Mobile URL, Name, Rating, Review Count, Snippet Text, URL, Population, Latitude, and Longitude.

Analysis and Vistualization: (Please check out: Part II_Query Database&Graph.ipynb)
- Since we want our users to be able to keep track of the different categories that they might be interested in, we used interactive plots to provide a better user experience.

Review Analysis: (Please check out: Part_III_Review_Analysis.ipynb)
- We used natural language processing to analyze the reviews from the Yelp API and find the common words that are used in the review by analyzing the best rated nearby restaurants, hotels and landmarks for all the cities in California. 

Interactive User Input: (Please check out: Part_IV_Basic_Info.ipynb)
- With the application of interactive user input functions, we want to provide a basic info of the city and the best recommendations of restaurants, hotels and landmarks to the users based on their preferences.

Conclusion & Next Step:

This travel guide has provided a comprehensive analysis for most restaurants, hotels and landmarks in California and make recommendations based on the users' preferences. Our next step will be creating a website that gets the user inputs displays the recommendations and plots. We will need to find a larger database that will contain more information and a web server that allows dynamic content. Furthermore, we will use this project as a template to create travel guides for other states as well.
