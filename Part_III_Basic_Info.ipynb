      "San Francisco (SF) (/sæn frənˈsɪskoʊ/, Spanish for Saint Francis; Spanish: [san fran.ˈθis.ko]), officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations.[23][24][25] Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about 47.9 square miles (124 km2)[17] in area, making it the smallest county—and the only consolidated city-county[26]—within the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km2), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City.[27] San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United States—with a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816.[20] The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.\n"
